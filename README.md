# DCT Image Compression Project

This repository contains a software project aimed at exploring the results achieved in grayscale image compression using the Bidimensional Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).

## Project Overview

The project consists of two main parts. 

### Part 1: DCT-2 Implementation Comparison

In the first part, we compare the execution time results between the implementation of DCT-2 using an Open Source library and a custom implementation from scratch. The goal is to evaluate the performance differences and understand the trade-offs of each approach.

### Part 2: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Implementation

The second part of the project involves the implementation of a user-friendly graphical interface that allows users to compress an image using customizable parameters. The GUI provides an intuitive way for users to interact with the compression algorithm and observe the resulting output. 

## Programming Environment

The project is developed using Python programming language. Specifically, we have chosen to utilize the `dctn` library for performing the DCT computations. Python was selected due to its simplicity, extensive libraries, and wide community support.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code files for the DCT implementations and the GUI.
- `data/`: Contains sample images used for testing and demonstration purposes.
- `docs/`: Documentation related to the project, including research papers, reference materials, and any additional resources.
- `tests/`: Unit tests to ensure the correctness and functionality of the implemented algorithms.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for setup and usage.
- `LICENSE`: The license information for the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dct-image-compression.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies. You can use the following command to install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the project by executing the main script. This will launch the graphical user interface:
   ```
   python src/main.py
   ```
